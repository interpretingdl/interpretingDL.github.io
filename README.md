# The InterpretingDL project website<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>

The website is running through Github Pages at [interpretingdl.github.io](http://interpretingdl.github.io) (note: www.interpretingdl.github.io does not work).
In brief, it is a static website generated by a piece of software called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
This is both low-tech and techy: no Wordpress, databases, log-in and fancy stuff, but just simple text files (markdown).

## Editing the website
What does Jekyll do? It generates a website based on what we put in the folder `source`.
So to update the website, we have to do two things: (1) change something in the folder `source` (for example the contents of one of the webpages).
Then (2) run Jekyll to generate an updated version of the website. *This means that new changes to the repository are not directly visible on the website.* Step (2) is described below under Technicalities.

## How is the site structured?
You should only look inside the folder `source`, the other files in the root directory are automatically generated by Jekyll when building the site.

Some files you might want to make changes in:
* `index.md` -- the contents of the homepage
* other `.md` files, usually in `_pages/` -- the other pages of the website (so far: members, methods, key papers)
* the `interpretingdl.bib` file in `publications/` -- the BibTeX file with all references
* if you want to upload an image, it should go in `assets/images/`

## Page structure
Jekyll files typically start with a *header* (between three dashes) with properties of the document (title, categories, etc), in YAML. These three dashes are important: they signal to Jekyll that it has to process the file.
It is probably best to leave the header as-is when you are editing a page.

Here's the bare minimum:
```
---
# some properties, like:
title: An example document
permalink: /example
---

Contents of the document (in markdown)

# A header

And some more **boldface** text or *italic* text. You can also add some HTML, e.g.
<img style="float: left" src="../assets/images/example.jpg">

```

## Questions or problems?

If there's a problem with the website, please create a new issue.

# Technicalities

## Setup
The website is a static website generated by Jekyll. To change the contents you have to edit markdown (or sometimes YAML) files. If you want to view the website locally from your computer, you can run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in your terminal (inside the `source/` directory). Then copy the given 'Server address' to your browser to view your beautiful creation.

To build a version of the website that can be read by Github Pages and served to visitors:
1. Run `jekyll build` in your terminal (inside the `source/` directory). Jekyll then builds a website based on the contents of the source directory into a folder called `_site/`.
2. In order to serve this new build to visitors, we overwrite the files in the root directory with the contents of of `_site/`. So the files in the root directory are never edited manually.
3. Push these changes to the github repository. After that, the changes should be visible online.
